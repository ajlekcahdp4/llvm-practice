# LLVM IR generation from C++ LLVM API

## About

- The `generation.cpp` file is the file with LLVM API code (which was generated by me using [llvm-api-gen](https://github.com/ajlekcahdp4/llvm-api-gen). Please, leave a star on it)
- The `ir.ll` file is the IR file generated with `generation.cpp`. It should not be tracked by git in the future, rather generated every time you run some target. But for now it is what it is.

## Run

I know, it's messy, but for now to launch it you have to run:

```sh
../build/ir-gen/ir-generator >& ir.ll
```

Now rebuild:

```sh
meson compile -C ../build highlife-generated  
```

It will compile `ir.ll` file that you generated above and now you can launch
the application with

```sh
../build/ir-gen/highlife-generated
```
